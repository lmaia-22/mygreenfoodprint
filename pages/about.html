              <p>The carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are produced by our actions, it contributes - highly and directly - to the climate changes that we observe and feel every single day.</p>
              <p>There is no way to avoid the GHGs as the emissons come from basically anything, people, organizations, events and products. However, the problem is that these are being produced on a huge scale that is no longer sustainable!</p>
              <p>As a normal footprint, the carbon footprint is the mark you leave on the environment with every single action of your daily rotine.
                The biggest contributors to the carbon emissions are the energy industry, which includes eletricity, heat and transports, followed by agriculture and food industry.</p>

          <p>As young and conscious people, we are worried with the future of our planet and we decided to take action and work towards a better world.</p>
          <p>This project was born after each one of us expressed a willingness to reduce its carbon footprint, but failed to do so.</p> 
          <p>As we are based in Portugal, the switch from driving a private car to work and school to public transports failed. Our country has a lack of public transportation means, which makes it difficult for you to avoid the CO2 emissions that are originated by cars.</p>
          <p>If we think about reducing carbon footprint, it will imply to change rotines and implement new habits, that at a first glance, have no direct positive impact on your life.</p>
          <p>For example, before you were driving your car to work, in order to recduce the GHGs, you decide to use a bike. You will be exposed to the weather, to more danger and your confort will be reduced. So the probability you give up and start to use your car again is high.We believe that in order to make a habit last, specially a one that will have effects not in a near future, it must be easy to implement.</p>
          <p>Based on this, we decided to attack the foood industry and create MyGreenFoodPrint.</p>
